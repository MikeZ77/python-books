# The chars we get out of a python str are unicode characters

# The actual bytes used to represent a character depend on the encoding used
# In the UTF-8 encoding A (U+0041) is encoded as the SINGLE byte \x41
# Other characters may need more bytes to encode them depending on how big the code point is
